# RWallet

## Introduction
This is a multi-cryptocurrency wallet application. Supports both english and spanish.

## Prerequisite

### To run on Android
1. In order to run this App in Android Simulator, **Android Studio** needs to be installed. Please refer to [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
1. Open Android Studio, create a device via `Tools > AVD Manager > Create Virtual Device`. After downloading required dependencies, start the device by clicking on Play icon.
1. Now we are testing if you can invoke `adb` in terminial. This is for running rWallet Android App on Android virtual device.
    1. Since we already have Android Studio installed we can add `platform-tools` to path
        ```
        echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.bash_profile
        echo 'export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile
        ```
    1. Then, refresh bash profile by `source ~/.bash_profile`
    1. Start using adb with `adb devices`
    1. If you have a virtual device running, it should show
        ```
        List of devices attached
        emulator-5554	device
        ```
### To run on iOS Devices
1. XCode needs to be installed. iOS simulator will be install along with XCode.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The first three steps are needed for both Android and iOS devices.

1. `npm install` to install dependencies. If you are using Windows, use `npm run install:windows` to install and fix the broken metro-config blacklist.js file.
1. Create an environment variable file named `.env` in the root directory
    ```
    # Parse server configuration
    # Server URL https://rwallet.app/v1
    # Devbox Server URL for Android Simulator http://10.0.2.2:1338/parse
    # Devbox Server URL for iOS Simulator http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:1338/parse
    # RWALLET_ENV: Production, Dogfood or others. If RWALLET_ENV value is "Production", or not set, the final server URL value is the same as Server URL such as "https://rwallet.app/v1"; otherwise, the RWALLET_ENV value will be prepended to Server URL in lower case as a sub-domain. For example, if RWALLET_ENV is "Dogfood" and Server URL is "https://rwallet.app/v1", the final URL is https://dogfood.rwallet.app/v1.

    PARSE_SERVER_URL=https://rwallet.app/v1
    RWALLET_API_KEY=6a740128-2ba2-4b82-9301-8cbe07208ee9
    RWALLET_ENV=Dogfood
    ```
    * If .env file is changed, manually edit the file importing react-native-dotenv (`rwallet/config.js`) by either adding an empty line or whitespace will work.
    * For security, we force the use of https to transfer data. If you use http during development, you need to set NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to true in the iOS environment and useCleartextTraffic to true in the Android environment.
    * **Note**: There are 2 examples for **Dogfood** (`.env_dogfood`) and **Local** (`.env_local`) environments for easy configuration. Copy the files to `.env` for a quick change of environments.
1.  In order to use firebase messaging on Android, put google-services.json in the android/app.
1. `npm run android` or `npm run ios`. The script will first start server daemon in a separate terminal window, the same effect as `npm run start`. You should see console output like below.
    ```
    > rwallet@0.0.1 start /Users/mikasa/Documents/repos/rwallet
    > node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start

    Looking for JS files in
      /Users/mikasa/Documents/repos/rwallet 

    Loading dependency graph, done.
    ```
    * For Android, `npm run android` will start the app in your physical device or Android virtual device. You need to check what device are available by running `adb devices` in terminal. To test the app in a physical Android device, you need to make sure **Developer Options -> Enable Debugging via USB** is turned on for that device.
        Note: If you encounter an error like below then you need to create a **local.properties** file under ./android and add one line `sdk.dir = /Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk` in it.
        ```
        SDK location not found. Define location with an ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at '/Users/<usernmae>/Documents/repos/rwallet/android/local.properties'.
        ```
    * For iOS device, `npm run ios` will start the App in iOS physical or virtual device.

1. Hot reload code change - Press Command + m on virtual device and select `Enable Hot Reloading` to hot reload file changes.

### Build on iOS
1. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b">The App Store will no longer accept new apps using UIWebView as of April 2020 and app updates using UIWebView as of December 2020.</a> Remove `Libraries/React.xcodeproj/React/Views/RCTWebView.h、RCTWebView.m、RCTWebViewManager.h、RCTWebViewManager.m` in Xcode to remove UIWebView.
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```
1. Set up fastlane match by running `fastlane match init`. __match__ is the alias for the `sync_code_signing` action. It creates all required certificates & provisioning profiles and stores them in a separate git repository. 
1. Gernerate certificates by `fastlane match appstore`
1. Once match is set, run `fastlane ios beta version:<version_number> build:<build_number>` to push to TestFlight.
    For example, `fastlane ios beta version:0.8.1 build:3` (build parameter can be omitted for auto-increment)

### build on Android
1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed, so that it is easy to sync the gradle build config.
1. To build the APK, run `fastlane android build_apk version:<version_number> code:<version_code>`

## Development
### Remote Debugging
#### Remote Debugging on iOS Simulator
1. Run `npm run ios` to start the app in Simulator.
1. Wait for the build


#### Remote Debugging on Android Devices
__Step 1: Discover your Android device__
1. Open the Developer Options screen on your Android. See [Configure On-Device Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html).
1. Select Enable USB Debugging
1. On your development machine, open Chrome.
1. Open DevTools.
1. In DevTools, click the Main Menu Main Menu then select More tools > Remote devices.
![Chrome Remote Debug Tools](docs/images/chrome-remote-debug-1.png)
1. In DevTools, open the Settings tab.
1. Make sure that the Discover USB devices checkbox is enabled.
1. Connect your Android device directly to your development machine using a USB cable. The first time you do this, you usually see that DevTools has detected an unknown device. If you see a green dot and the text Connected below the model name of your Android device, then DevTools has successfully established the connection to your device. 
![First Time Connect Android Device](docs/images/first-time-connect-android.png)
1. If your device is showing up as Unknown, accept the Allow USB Debugging permission prompt on your Android device.

__Step 2: Debug content on your Android device from your development machine__
